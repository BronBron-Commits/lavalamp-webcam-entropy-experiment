Lava Lamp Webcam Entropy Experiment

This project lives on a Raspberry Pi and uses a webcam pointed at a lava lamp to gather natural visual randomness.  
Everything starts here: capture images, save them locally, and later extract entropy from the pixel noise.

Folders:
img/   stores captured pictures  
logs/  stores entropy logs later  
src/   contains code for capturing and processing
